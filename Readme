Project Title
Continuous Integration Test Automation Script

Project Overview
As part of a virtual internship offered by Quantium through Forage, developed a bash script to automate the execution of the projectâ€™s test suite within a Python virtual environment. The script was designed to integrate seamlessly into a CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that all tests are executed automatically with each code change. This process reinforces continuous integration practices by providing immediate feedback on test results and maintaining codebase stability.

Responsibilities & Achievements
Automated the test execution process using a custom bash script.

Ensured compatibility with CI engines by returning exit status based on test outcomes.

Managed Python virtual environments to isolate dependencies.

Practiced version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.

Technologies Used
Python 3.10

pytest

Bash scripting

Git & GitHub

Virtualenv
